## About Me  
I’m a final-year engineering student who loves blending **creativity and data** — from designing smart web apps to training models that actually *learn*.  
I spend my time experimenting with **AI/ML**, **web development**, and **problem-solving**, mostly fueled by late-night coffee and stubborn curiosity.  

- Currently working on **Plant Intellect** — a smart plant health monitoring system (my final year project ).  
- 🧠 Skilled in AI-driven systems, NLP, and LLM-based solutions (especially RAG).  
- Passionate about hackathons and creating projects that make life simpler or at least more interesting.  
- 🎯 Preparing for product-based company placements .
